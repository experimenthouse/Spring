# Spring
File management software for law firms

## Overview

Spring will be a web-based file management solution for law firms built on free and open-source technologies.

Although there exist many applications for managing client files, these tend to be frustrating and inefficient to use, with steep learning curves and confusing workflows.

Spring will include all the tools required to keep accurate client files, while focusing on ease and efficiency of use.

## Key features

Spring will include:

- a platform for managing client files, including the presentation of essential information, progress of the file, and relevant documents;
- the ability to draft consistently-formatted letters and documents based on customisable templates;
- a catalogue of precedents for documents such as wills and leases;
- the ability to send and receive letters automatically linked to a file, or manually-linkable to a file;
- functionality for logging time spent working on files; and
- the ability to record and log phone calls.

## Managing client files: Jekyll

A central list of client files from which detailed files can be accessed is necessary. Although Jekyll is intended as a blogging platform, it has many features that lend itself to managing client files.

## Letters and other documents: LaTeX
